# XYZ Book

Easy-to-use book for coordinates storage.

### Huh?

This book makes it easy to save coordinates. Instead of writing them manually, you write only the name of location, and the mod will do the rest for you. The coordinates will be added to the book automatically. Also the coordinates will be colored with current dimension (green for Overworld, red for Nether and purple for The End).

### Usage

You need to rename the Book and Quill with the Anvil so that the name contains the letters "XYZ".

After that the book's GUI changes: "Sign" button replaced with "New Entry" button.

If you click on it, the add entry page will open. There will also be a detailed description:

### CIT Resewn

I recommend installing the [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) mod to see the special texture of this book. But this is not necessary, the book will function even without it.
